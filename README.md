# Unhandled Error in Express.js POST Route

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: a lack of robust error handling for invalid or missing request data in POST requests.

The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code.  The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the corrected code with proper error handling.

## Bug
The original code lacks error handling for cases where the request body (`req.body`) is missing or doesn't contain the expected data. This can lead to unexpected application crashes or silent failures.

## Solution
The solution includes comprehensive error handling that checks for the presence and validity of the data before processing it.  It provides informative error responses to the client, improving the application's resilience and user experience.
